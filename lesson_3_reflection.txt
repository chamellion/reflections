Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork basically is a copy of someone's else's repository on Github directly into your account on Github, while a clone is copying a repository from github account into your own local device, and branches are used when adding functionality or test running something and you dont want it to update the nmaster yet.

stored locally?
