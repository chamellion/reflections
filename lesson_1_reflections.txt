How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it was really helpful in the way it formatted the data for viewing

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it will allow me take risk with changing functionality in codes without worrying about repercusions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually saving allows you to save specific changes to code at your time, while automatic saving saves a whole lot of irrelevant changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   its easier keeping track of all changes made to different files when apps like GIT saves all files at once rather than treating the files one after the other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by typing git log in the command line which shows you all the commits that have been made and copying the commit id to compare the code changes using git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It gives you the confidence that even if u make a mistake or introduce a bug to your code, you can always rely on having a backup of your previous code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To save previous versions of my projects and have a backup of my files
